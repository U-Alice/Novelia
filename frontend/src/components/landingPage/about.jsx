          For much of their history and all of prehistory, humans did not see
          themselves as being any different from the other animals among which
          they lived. Hunter-gatherers saw their prey as equals, if not
          superiors, and animals were worshipped as divinities in many
          traditional cultures. The humanist sense of a gulf between ourselves
          and other animals is an aberration. Feeble as it is today, the feeling
          of sharing a common destiny with other living things is embedded in
          the human psyche. Those who struggle to conserve what is left of the
          natural environment are moved by the love of living things, biophilia,
          the frail bond of feeling that ties humankind to the Earth.
